📌 Project Objective
The primary goal of this capstone project is to apply advanced data analytics techniques to real-world HR data. This project addresses employee attrition, satisfaction, performance, and turnover prediction using Python-based data analytics and machine learning methods.

🔍 Problem Statement
HR departments often face challenges in identifying key drivers of employee attrition. The purpose of this project is to:

Understand the current state of employee engagement and turnover.

Identify patterns and key variables influencing attrition.

Build predictive models to support decision-making.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Language: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

IDE: Jupyter Notebook

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.

📊 Data Overview
The dataset HR_Sailfort_dataset.csv contains anonymized HR data including features such as:

Age, Department, JobSatisfaction, MonthlyIncome, Attrition, YearsAtCompany, etc.

✅ Project Workflow

📈 Results Summary
Model Performance: The best-performing model was able to predict employee attrition with reasonable accuracy.

Key Influencers: Job satisfaction, monthly income, overtime, and years at company were among the top predictors.

📌 Future Enhancements
Incorporating more external data (e.g., job market trends).

Using advanced ML models like XGBoost or neural networks.

Deploying the model using Streamlit or Flask.
